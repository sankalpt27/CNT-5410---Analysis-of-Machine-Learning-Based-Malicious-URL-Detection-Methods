The goal of this survey is to  analyse the performance of various machine learning and deep learning models for detection of malicious URLs. 

A zip file of the dataset is present in the repository. 

There are 5 python notebooks present in the repository: 
1. Lexical_Analysis.ipynb - Analyzes the lexical features and runs on various ML models. 
2. Host_Features.ipynb - Analyzes the host features and runs on various ML models. 
3. Combined_ML_Models.ipynb - Analyzes all the features (lexical and host) and runs on various ML models. 
4. cnn-for-malicious-url.ipynb - Analyses the dataset using Convolutional Neural Net
5. malicious-url-detection-using-gru.ipynb - Analyses the dataset using Convolutional Neural Net

Instructions:
1. Download all the files. 
2. Unzip the dataset in the same location as that of the notebook files. 
3. Makes sure the path mentioned in each notebook for the csv is appropriate. (check directory location at pandas.read_csv part of the code)
